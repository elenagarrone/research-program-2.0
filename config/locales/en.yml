# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          h3: "What are we doing?"
          p1: "We are conducting a research project to develop and test a mobile application for Health-Related Quality of Life assessment. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is a multi-dimensional concept that includes domains related to physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning."
        -
          h3: "Why are we doing this?"
          p1: "The use of mobile applications in healthcare is increasing, and we need to know more about the best ways to develop and incorporate them in practice. As the measure of HRQoL has been shown to predict and directly influence clinical outcomes (e.g. survival, physical activity) in prominent conditions such as cancer, we want to determine the best method of assessment to be used in clinical settings."
          p2: "Traditionally, HRQoL assessment using paper- or web-based questionnaires relies on people recalling recent events and feelings. This can be problematic because our memory can be biased by factors such as mood and memory decline. Furthermore, the feasibility of this kind of HRQoL assessment can be limited by the time and monetary costs of travel to and from places in which assessments take place."
          p3: "The above issues justify our investigation of the looking at new, different ways of assessing HRQoL. Mobile applications seem a promising method because their use could overcome many of the challenges faced by traditional HRQoL measurement."
        -
          h3: "How are we doing this?"
          p1: "We have developed a mobile application with the purpose of gathering information about HRQoL in real-time, therefore avoiding the problems associated with looking back in time. When using the mobile application, it is also possible to collect information about current mood and activities, contextual factors that may affect the accuracy of the assessment."
        -
          h3: "Implications"
          p1: "You are free to decide if you would like to contribute to our objective, alongside people from all over the world. Your participation would help us to determine whether or not the mobile application offers a valid, reliable and realistic method of assessing HRQoL in real-time."
          p2: "We expect real-time collection of health-related information might help physicians to keep track of their patients’ Quality of Life. This could lead to more individualised treatment, as it could enhance the quality and quantity of information they share."
          p3: "Last but not least, our method will be cost-efficient in terms of time and money, also improving the assessment of HRQoL by being sensitive to the context in which responses are provided."
  ethics:
    h1: "Ethics"
    p1: "We are an independent research team, and our research project adheres to the ethical guidelines provided by each research group member’s institution and/or home country. For more information, please contact the Junior Researcher associated with your location."
    p2: "We will ensure the security of all information collected during the assessment period by storing the mobile application data in a cloud-based database accessible only by the Research Supervisor. Answers will be anonymous, and every effort will be made to ensure confidentiality. We would like to emphasise that no corporations or third parties will have access to the data, and that the results will not be used for commercial purposes."
